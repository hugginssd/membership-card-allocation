             <p>This system allows all registered users to request for their Membership Card from the Party.</p>
             <p>
                Last, all you have to do is add your name and email address, so we can send you your admin link, 
                and then send it off to your guests or participants. You can add their email addresses in the box on the
                poll page or you can simply share the link as you like. In minutes youâ€™ll have your responses and have 
                just used the online voting system. Pretty cool!
